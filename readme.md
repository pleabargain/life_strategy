It took six interations to get the code to work with GPT4. You can see them in the repo. 

Some of it was my fault as I hadn't thought through the problem clearly.

In the final main.py the db code is edited so that it doesn't wipe out my db each time I call main.py

* create a web interface for the code (sliders would be nice)

* Allow users to annotate their choices with reasons for their choices
